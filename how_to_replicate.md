# Replicating bugs

This document outlines the "who", the "why", and the "how" for replicating issues from the _Needs to be replicated_ column of the [Learning Lab course maintenance project board](https://github.com/orgs/githubtraining/projects/1).

## Who?

If you are able to complete the Learning Lab course in question, then you are able to contribute by replicating bugs! This is a great way to contribute even if you aren't ready to submit a pull request.

## Why?

We frequently get reports of bugs from the community. Frequently, when something is broken, we receive multiple reports. But, sometimes we only get one report. Before investing the time in fixing these bugs, we want to confirm a few things.

- Confirm that bug is with the Learning Lab course, not other systems
- Understand the scope, impact, and detail of the bug

Once we have this information, we are prepared to either close the issue or move the issue to another column so that it can be fixed.

## How?

1. Read the issue
2. Sign up for the course in question, and try to duplicate the original user's situation
3. Document your experience in detail around the steps where the original user encountered problems
4. Share your notes, screenshots, and any additional detail or context in that issue and mention @githubtraining/programs
5. Someone from the @githubtraining/programs team will move this from the **Needs review** column to a more appropriate column. If you'd like to address the issue, please feel free to go ahead and open a pull request - no need to wait for it to be triaged!
