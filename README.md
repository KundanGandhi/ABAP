# Welcome to the GitHub Training Community

The `githubtraining` organization is home to all of the open source training materials and courses created by the GitHub Training team. We believe knowledge is meant to be shared and, by open sourcing these courses and project repositories, we hope you'll join us in our quest to make technology education available to everyone with the :heart: and desire to learn.

## How to use this repository

This repository is intended to be a central gathering place, sorta like the town square for our Open Source Community. We'll post topics for discussion, upcoming events, and other helpful information.

## Our courses

You can find all of our open source courses by [selecting the `learning-lab` topic](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alearning-lab+org%3Agithubtraining+fork%3Atrue) on the `githubtraining` organization page.

### Contributing to a course

Check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repository for more information on how you can contribute to these courses.

The [course maintenance project board](https://github.com/orgs/githubtraining/projects/1) features open issues and pull requests. Look here if you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to start. The [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) also features details about how to interact with this project board.

### Contributing a new bot behavior

If you'd like to train the bot to do something new, you can do that in the [learning-lab-components](https://github.com/github/learning-lab-components) repository.

## We're here to help

If you have questions about building (or taking) courses, you can ask them here or in the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Learning-Lab/bd-p/learn).
